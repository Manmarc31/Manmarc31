- 🌱 I’m currently learning I'm currently learning physics, especially non-destructive testing using acoustic waves. Modelling and simulating acoustic phenomena are part of my daily headaches.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on I'm looking to collaborate with an expert in Matlab and Ansys and someone who knows something about mechanics and acoustics. I'm currently working on a code that will enable me to calculate and draw the reflection and transmission coefficients of a multilayer in 2D and 3D, as well as the dispersion curves of such a medium using matrix methods.
